Evaluate the system summary based on the provided reference summary. Determine whether each of the following types of information is present in the system summary:

1. **Plaintiff**: The person or group initiating legal action.

For each category, assign one of the following values:

2. **Included (contradiction)**: Present in both summaries but details contradict each other.
3. **Included (extra)**: Present in the system summary but not in the reference summary, or present in both summaries but with additional details in the system summary.
4. **Included (incomplete)**: Present in both summaries but lacking some details from the reference summary.
5. **Not included**: Not present in the system summary.
