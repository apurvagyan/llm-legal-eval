{"doc_id": 2, "human_summary": "On September 21, 2007, the EEOC filed a claim in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 on behalf of two aggrieved female employees.  The EEOC alleged that Defendant, Bodega Bars, engaged in unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex.  Specifically, the EEOC claimed that the two female employees were subjected to egregious sexual harassment by one of Defendant's customers, and Defendant did not take appropriate corrective action despite the employees' repeated complaints.  Furthermore, the propositions, touching, and graphic sexual comments by the customer allegedly created a sexually hostile work environment for the employees that was so oppressive that they were forced to resign their employment.  The EEOC sought injunctive and monetary relief.\n\nOn November 30, 2007, the District Court (Judge Charles A. Shaw) granted a motion to intervene by the two employees.  The plaintiff-intervenors filed their complaint that same day, making the same claims as included in the original complaint.\n\nThe District Court (Judge Donald J. Stohr) then approved a settlement between the parties under a consent decree on July 2, 2008.  The decree accorded general injunctive relief, requiring that Defendant not engage in sexual harassment or sex discrimination in any of its restaurants against its employees.  The decree also provided that Defendant pay $64,000 in monetary damages ($32,000 each) to the two aggrieved employees.  Defendant was also required to take reasonable steps to exclude from its premises the customer at issue.  \n\nThe decree further provided that Defendant establish a sexual harassment policy that would be distributed to all of its employees, as well as provide two hours of training on the policy to its managers. The consent decree was to be in effect for a period of two years.\n\nOn June 28th, 2010, the Court extended the consent decree by a further six months, due to allegations by the Plaintiffs that the Defendant failed to comply with the terms of the consent decree. The Plaintiffs specifically alleged that the Defendants failed to pay the last $10,000 in monetary damages to the two aggrieved employees.\n\nThere has been no further activity on this case since the June 28th, 2010 order, and the case is now closed.", "system_summary": "In the case of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Plaintiff-Intervenors Aimee Boss and Morgan Hagedon v. Bodega Bars USA, LLC d/b/a Mosaic Restaurant, the lawsuit was initiated under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to address unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex, and specifically to rectify the egregious sexual harassment suffered by female employees, including plaintiffs Aimee Boss and Morgan Hagedon, at the hands of Andrew Gladney, a customer and investor of the defendant, Bodega Bars USA, LLC, which operates under the name Mosaic Restaurant. \n\nThe initial complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Eastern Division (Civil Action No. 4:07-CV-1645-DJS), sought to correct these injustices and provide appropriate relief to those affected. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), acting on behalf of Boss and Hagedon, demanded a jury trial. The jurisdiction was invoked pursuant to various statutes, including 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337, 1343, and 1345, under the authorization of Section 706(f)(1) and (3) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3)).\n\nThe primary remedy sought in this case included a permanent injunction against the defendant to prohibit further sexual harassment and discrimination, as well as compensatory damages for past and future losses, punitive damages for the malicious and reckless conduct displayed by the defendants, and any additional relief deemed proper by the Court, including attorneys' fees and costs associated with the action.\n\nThe last significant action in this case was the filing of a Consent Decree on July 2, 2008, by Judge Donald J. Stohr, which mandated Bodega Bars to pay the Plaintiff-Intervenors a total sum of $64,000 ($32,000 each), undergo sexual harassment training, and implement a sexual harassment policy. This Consent Decree came after a mediated settlement was reached and aimed to address and rectify the unlawful employment practices complained of.\n\nHowever, a subsequent motion filed on June 11, 2010 (Document 34), indicated that Bodega Bars USA, LLC, had failed to comply with the terms of the Consent Decree, specifically, its financial obligations to the Plaintiff-Intervenors, which as of the filing of said motion accounted to $10,000 unpaid. The plaintiffs requested an Order from the Court for the defendant to show cause why it should not be held in contempt for this failure. The motion highlighted ongoing efforts to resolve the non-compliance outside of court, including extensive communication between the parties' attorneys. The motion also sought an extension of the Consent Decree and compensation for attorneys' fees incurred due to the defendant's non-compliance.", "src_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI\nEASTERN DIVISION\n\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION,\nPlaintiff,\nv.\nBODEGA BARS USA, LLC d/b/a MOSAIC RESTAURANT,\nDefendant.\n\n) ) ) ) CIVIL ACTION NO. ) ) ) JURY TRIAL DEMANDED ) ) )\n\nNATURE OF THE ACTION This is an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to correct unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex and to provide appropriate relief to female employees, including Aimee Boss and Morgan Hagedon, who were adversely affected by such practices. The Complaint alleges that while employed as bartenders by Defendant, Bodega Bars USA, d/b/a Mosaic Restaurant, Boss and Hagedon were subjected to egregious sexual harassment on account of their sex by Andrew Gladney with the full knowledge of Defendant's owners and managers, including Claus Schmitz and Greg Doyle. The sexual harassment altered the terms and conditions of their employment. Despite their complaints, Defendant failed to take appropriate corrective action following the sexual harassment and otherwise condoned the sexual harassment of Boss and Hagedon by Gladney. The Complaint further alleges that the sexual comments, propositions and touchings by Gladney created a sexually hostile environment that was so oppressive that Boss and Hagedon were forced to resign their employment when Defendant unreasonably failed to take prompt and\n\n\feffective action to end the sexual harassment, but rather allowed the harassment to continue unabated knowing that it would force Boss and Hagedon to resign.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337, 1343 and 1345. This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706(f) (1) and (3) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f) (1) and (3) (\"Title VII\"). 2. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Eastern Division.\nPARTIES 3. Plaintiff, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \"Commission\"), is the agency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and enforcement of Title VII, and is expressly authorized to bring this action by Section 706(f)(1) and (3) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3). 4. At all relevant times, Defendant, Bodega Bars USA, LLC, has continuously been a Missouri corporation doing business in the State of Missouri and the City of St. Louis, and has continuously had at least 15 employees. 5. At all relevant times, Bodega Bars USA, LLC d/b/a Mosaic Restaurant, has continuously been an employer engaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Sections 701(b), (g) and (h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e (b), (g) and (h).\n2\n\n\fSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS 6. More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Boss and Hagedon each filed a charge with the Commission alleging violations of Title VII by Defendant. All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled. 7. Since at least December 3, 2004, Defendant has engaged in unlawful employment practices at its facility located at 1101 Lucas Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri, in violation of Section 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e-2(a), as follows: (a) Defendant subjected Boss and Hagedon, both bartenders, to unlawful sexual harassment during their employment in violation of Section 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e-2(a). The unlawful conduct was directed toward Boss and Hagedon by Andrew Gladney on a nearly daily basis beginning with the opening of Defendant's restaurant and continuing until Boss and Hagedon were constructively discharged in January 2005 and February 2005, respectively. Gladney made extremely graphic and offensive sexual comments to Boss and Hagedon, attempted to solicit sexual acts from each, and invited each to use cocaine while engaging in sexual activity with him. These remarks were made openly in the bar area of Defendant's restaurant in the presence of Boss' and Hagedon's supervisor, Greg Doyle, and in the presence of the majority owner of Defendant, Claus Schmitz. In addition, Gladney touched Hagedon on numerous occasions by patting her posterior, hugging her, and attempting to fondle her breasts. Boss complained to Doyle about Gladney's actions and Hagedon complained to both Schmitz and Doyle about Gladney's actions, but Defendant failed to take any measures to end Gladney's conduct prior to the constructive discharge of Boss.\n3\n\n\fThe unlawful conduct was unwelcome, sexual in nature, and directed at Boss and Hagedon because of their sex. The unlawful conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile working environment for Boss and Hagedon which altered the terms and conditions of their employment.\n(b) As a result of Gladney's sexually harassing conduct and Defendant's failure to take prompt and effective measures to end such conduct, the working conditions for both Boss and Hagedon became so hostile and oppressive that each was compelled to end their employment with Defendant. Defendant had knowledge that the sexual harassment of Boss and Hagedon by Gladney caused their working conditions to be so intolerable that each would be forced to resign. Nevertheless, Defendant deliberately and unreasonably failed to take prompt and effective actions to end the harassment and knew that its inaction would result in the resignations of Boss and Hagedon.\n8. The effect of the practice(s) complained of in paragraphs 7(a) and (b) above has been to deprive Boss and Hagedon of equal employment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect their status as employees because of their sex.\n9. The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs 7(a) and (b) above were intentional.\n10. The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs 7(a) and (b) above were done with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of Boss and Hagedon.\n4\n\n\fPRAYER FOR RELIEF Wherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: A. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant, its officers, successors, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with them, from engaging in sexual harassment, intimidation, discharge, and any other employment practice which discriminates on the basis of sex. B. Order Defendant to institute and carry out policies, practices, and programs which provide equal employment opportunities for women and which eradicate the effects of its past and present unlawful employment practices. C. Order Defendant to make whole Boss and Hagedon, by providing appropriate backpay with prejudgment interest, in amounts to be determined at trial, and other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of its unlawful employment practices, including but not limited to rightful place reinstatement of Boss and Hagedon. D. Order Defendant to make whole Boss and Hagedon, by providing compensation for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful employment practices described in paragraphs 7(a) and (b) above, in amounts to be determined at trial. E. Order Defendant to make whole Boss and Hagedon by providing compensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful practices complained of in paragraphs 7(a) and (b), including emotional distress, pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of reputation, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial.\n5\n\n\fF. Order Defendant to pay punitive damages for its malicious and reckless\nconduct described in paragraphs 7(a) and (b) above, in amounts to be determined at trial.\nG. Grant such further relief as the Court deems necessary and proper in the\npublic interest.\nH. Award the Commission its costs of this action.\nJURY TRIAL DEMAND\nThe Commission requests a jury trial on all questions of fact raised by its\ncomplaint.\nRespectfully submitted,\nRONALD S.

(\u201cTitle VII\u201d) and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 by committing\n\nunlawful employment practices with respect to its employees, Aimee Boss and Morgan Hagedon,\n\nsubjecting them to sexual harassment by defendant\u2019s customer and investor, and constructively\n\ndischarging them. On November 29, 2007, movants filed the motion to intervene as a matter of right\n\nin this action, citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) and Rule 24(a)(1), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nUnder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1), an aggrieved employee has an absolute right to intervene\n\nin a civil action brought by the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1); see EEOC v. Contour Chair\n\nLounge Co., 596 F.2d 809 (8th Cir. 1979). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), however, imposes\n\n\fCase 4:07-cv-01645-DJS Document 11 Filed 11/30/07 Page 2 of 3\nthe requirement that the application to intervene be timely. Nevilles v. EEOC, 511 F.2d 303 (8th Cir. 1975). Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 motion should be analyzed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a). Rule 24(a)(2) provides that a timely motion to intervene shall be granted if: (1) the proposed intervenor claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action; (2) the interest may be impaired; and (3) the interest is not adequately represented by an existing party to the action. See Jenkins by Jenkins v. State of Missouri, 78 F.3d 1270, 1274 (8th Cir. 1996). Further, as a threshold matter, a proposed intervenor under Rule 24 must have Article III standing. Curry v. Regents of the Univ. of Minn., 167 F.3d 420, 422 (8th Cir. 1999). Standing under Article III of the Constitution requires that a would-be litigant make a showing of three elements: (1) an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d which is an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete, particularized and either actual or imminent; (2) the existence of a causal connection between the alleged injury and the conduct being challenged; and (3) redressability; i.e., that the injury is likely to be remedied by a favorable decision. Id.\nThe Court finds that movants Boss and Hagedon have standing because they allege injury in fact, i.e., a violation of Title VII, there is a causal connection between their alleged injuries and the conduct of defendant being challenged, and the injury is likely to be remedied by a favorable decision. The Court also finds that Boss and Hagedon\u2019s motion to intervene is timely, and they meet the elements of Rule 24(a). The first element is easily satisfied, because Boss and Hagedon claim an interest in the resolution of claims that they suffered sexual harassment at their place of employment.

Plaintiff-Intervenors Aimee Boss and Morgan Hagedon bring this action for legal\n\nand equitable relief to redress the injuries done to them by Defendant Bodega Bars USA, LLC\n\nd/b/a Mosaic Restaurant.\n\n2. Plaintiff-Intervenors bring their complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964, as amended (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. As the aggrieved parties, they have\n\nthe right to intervene in this case under Section 706(f)(1) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1).\n\nJurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.\n\n3. The unlawful employment practices complained of herein were committed within\n\n\fCase 4:07-cv-01645-DJS Document 12 Filed 11/30/07 Page 2 of 5\nthe Eastern District of Missouri. 4. Plaintiff-Intervenor Aimee Boss is a female citizen of the United States who, at all\nrelevant times, resided in Belleville, Illinois. 5. Plaintiff-Intervenor Morgan Hagedon is a female citizen of the United States who,\nat all relevant times, resided in St. Louis, Missouri. 6. At all relevant times, Defendant Bodega Bars USA, LLC d/b/a Mosaic Restaurant\nhas been a Missouri corporation doing business in the State of Missouri and the City of St. Louis, has continuously had at least 15 employees, and has been an employer within the meaning of Section 701(b), (g), and (h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b), (g), and (h).\n7. Since at least December 3, 2004, Defendant has engaged in the following unlawful employment practices at its facilities located at 1101 Lucas Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri, in violation of Section 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a).\n8. Defendant subjected Plaintiff-Intervenors Boss and Hagedon, both bartenders, to unlawful sexual harassment during their employment. The unlawful conduct was directed toward them by Andrew Gladney, a customer and investor in Defendant, on a nearly daily basis beginning with the opening of Defendant\u2019s restaurant and continuing until Plaintiff-Intervenors Boss and Hagedon were constructively discharged in January 2005 and February 12005, respectively.\n9. Gladney made extremely graphic and offensive comments to Plaintiff-Intervenors Boss and Hagedon, attempted to solicit sexual acts from each, and invited each to use cocaine while engaging in sexual activity with him. These remarks were made openly in the bar area of Defendant\u2019s restaurant in the presence of their supervisor, Greg Doyle, and in the presence of the majority owner of Defendant, Claus Schmitz. In addition, Gladney touched Plaintiff-Intervenor\n\n\fCase 4:07-cv-01645-DJS Document 12 Filed 11/30/07 Page 3 of 5\nHagedon on numerous occasions by patting her posterior, hugging her, and attempting to fondle her breasts. Plaintiff-Intervenor Boss complained to Doyle about Gladney\u2019s actions, and Plaintiff-Intervenor Hagedon complained to both Schmitz and Doyle about Gladney\u2019s actions, but Defendant failed to take prompt and effective action to end the harassment prior to their constructive discharge.\n10. The unlawful conduct was unwelcome, sexual in nature, and directed at PlaintiffIntervenors Boss and Hagedon because of their sex. The unlawful conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile working environment that altered the terms and conditions of the employment of Plaintiff-Intervenors Boss and Hagedon.\n11. As a result of Gladney\u2019s sexually harassing conduct and Defendant\u2019s failure to take prompt and effective measures to end such conduct, the working conditions for both Plaintiff- Intervenors became so hostile and oppressive that each was compelled to end her employment with Defendant. Defendant had knowledge that the sexual harassment of PlaintiffIntervenors by Gladney caused their working conditions to be so intolerable that each would be forced to resign. Nevertheless, Defendant deliberately and unreasonably failed to take prompt and effective actions to end the harassment and knew that its inaction would result in the resignations of Plaintiff-Intervenors.\n12. As a result of Defendant\u2019s aforementioned conduct, Plaintiff-Intervenors have lost compensation and benefits of employment.\n13. Defendant\u2019s conduct was undertaken with malice and reckless indifference to Plaintiff-Intervenors\u2019 federally protected rights.\n14. Plaintiff-Intervenors have incurred and will continue to incur attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in connection with this matter.\n\n\fCase 4:07-cv-01645-DJS Document 12 Filed 11/30/07 Page 4 of 5\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff-Intervenors pray for judgment in their favor and against Defendant for lost wages and other benefits of employment; front pay; compensatory damages for their emotional distress, pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of reputation, and humiliation; punitive damages; appropriate injunctive relief; prejudgment interest; attorneys' fees and costs; and for such additional relief as this Court deems appropriate.\nSEDEY HARPER P.C.

See Declaration of Jan Simpson attached hereto as Exhibit A. Attorneys for Plaintiff-Intervenors and the Commission have engaged in substantial efforts to obtain Defendant\u2019s compliance with the Consent Decree. The attorney for Plaintiff EEOC and the attorney for Plaintiff-Intervenors have corresponded extensively (including exchanging more than 70 emails) with Defendant\u2019s attorney in a regular, periodic, and unsuccessful effort to obtain Defendant\u2019s compliance with the Consent Decree. See Declaration of C. Felix Miller attached hereto as Exhibit B. Despite these efforts, Defendant has failed to pay the Plaintiff-Intervenors a total of $10,000, exclusive of interest, owing since March, 2009, in violation of the Consent Decree.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff EEOC and Plaintiff-Intervenors Boss and Hagedon request that the Court issue an Order requiring Defendant to appear before this Court on a date certain to be fixed in the Order and to show cause, if there be any, why it should not be adjudged in contempt of the Court for violating the terms of the Consent Decree. Plaintiffs further request the Court extend the duration of the Decree by thirty (30) days after Defendant has satisfied all its obligations under the Consent Decree in order to permit Plaintiffs an opportunity to seek their reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in seeking to obtain compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree.\n2\n\n\fCase: 4:07-cv-01645-DJS Doc. #: 34 Filed: 06/11/10 Page: 3 of 4 PageID #: 120\nThe basis for these requests is detailed in a Memorandum in Support submitted simultaneously with this Application and incorporated herein as if fully set forth.\nRespectfully Submitted, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION /s/ C.

The EEOC alleged that Defendant, Bodega Bars, engaged in unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex.  Specifically, the EEOC claimed that the two female employees were subjected to egregious sexual harassment by one of Defendant's customers, and Defendant did not take appropriate corrective action despite the employees' repeated complaints.  Furthermore, the propositions, touching, and graphic sexual comments by the customer allegedly created a sexually hostile work environment for the employees that was so oppressive that they were forced to resign their employment.  The EEOC sought injunctive and monetary relief.\n\nOn November 30, 2007, the District Court (Judge Charles A. Shaw) granted a motion to intervene by the two employees.  The plaintiff-intervenors filed their complaint that same day, making the same claims as included in the original complaint.\n\nThe District Court (Judge Donald J. Stohr) then approved a settlement between the parties under a consent decree on July 2, 2008.  The decree accorded general injunctive relief, requiring that Defendant not engage in sexual harassment or sex discrimination in any of its restaurants against its employees.  The decree also provided that Defendant pay $64,000 in monetary damages ($32,000 each) to the two aggrieved employees.  Defendant was also required to take reasonable steps to exclude from its premises the customer at issue.  \n\nThe decree further provided that Defendant establish a sexual harassment policy that would be distributed to all of its employees, as well as provide two hours of training on the policy to its managers. The consent decree was to be in effect for a period of two years.\n\nOn June 28th, 2010, the Court extended the consent decree by a further six months, due to allegations by the Plaintiffs that the Defendant failed to comply with the terms of the consent decree. The Plaintiffs specifically alleged that the Defendants failed to pay the last $10,000 in monetary damages to the two aggrieved employees.\n\nThere has been no further activity on this case since the June 28th, 2010 order, and the case is now closed.", "system_raw": "In the case of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Plaintiff-Intervenors Aimee Boss and Morgan Hagedon v.

The EEOC alleged that Defendant, Bodega Bars, engaged in unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex.  Specifically, the EEOC claimed that the two female employees were subjected to egregious sexual harassment by one of Defendant's customers, and Defendant did not take appropriate corrective action despite the employees' repeated complaints.  Furthermore, the propositions, touching, and graphic sexual comments by the customer allegedly created a sexually hostile work environment for the employees that was so oppressive that they were forced to resign their employment.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), acting on behalf of Boss and Hagedon, demanded a jury trial.
