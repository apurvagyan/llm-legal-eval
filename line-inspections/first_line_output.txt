{"doc_id": 1, "human_summary": "On February 12, 2007, an arrestee, represented by private attorney Mark E. Merin, filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in order to challenge the County Sheriff's policies and practices concerning the use of strip and visual body cavity searches in Santa Cruz County Jail.  Plaintiff, who was arrested on outstanding warrants for vehicle code violations, alleged that officers routinely subjected detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the detainees possessed contraband or weapons.  He alleged that such practices violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution as well as California state law.  To remedy the alleged violations, Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.\n\nOn July 2, 2008, the parties filed a settlement agreement.  Under the terms of the settlement, the defendants agree to pay $3,875,000 in damages to a class of parties who had been wrongfully strip-searched by the defendants.  Members of the plaintiff class would receive $1,250 if they had been wrongfully searched when booked for a misdemeanor, and they would receive $750 if they had been wrongfully searched when booked for a felony. They would receive an additional $500 if they were under 21 or over 60, had a physical or mental disability, or were pregnant at the time of the search. The settlement also covered attorneys fees and administrative costs of the settlement.\n\nOn January 28, 2009, the district court (Judge Jeremy Fogel) issued a final approval of the settlement and dismissed the case.", "system_summary": "The case \"Butler v. Santa Cruz County et al,\" Case No. C 07-00941 JF, was filed on February 14, 2007, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division. The plaintiff, Dennis Butler, on behalf of himself and all similarly situated individuals, initiated a class-action lawsuit against Santa Cruz County, Santa Cruz County Sheriff Steve Robbins (in his individual and official capacities), and Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Deputies (Does 1 through 50) and Roes 1 through 20.\n\nThis legal action sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and punitive damages for violations of the plaintiffs' rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, alleging illegal policies, practices, and customs concerning strip searches and visual body cavity searches at the Santa Cruz County Jail. Specifically, the complaint contended that the defendants subjected detainees to strip and visual body cavity searches without proper legal basis, such as before arraignment and without any reasonable suspicion that such searches would yield contraband, and in a manner that violated the detainees' rights to privacy and against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThe class, represented by Mark E. Merin, Esq., included all persons who were arrested and subjected to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches at the Santa Cruz County Jail within the period from and including two years before the filing of the complaint and continuing to the date of adjudication, excluding any persons who had been arrested on two or more occasions on violence, drugs, or weapons felony or misdemeanor offenses in Santa Cruz County within the seven years preceding the booking or were on parole at the time of booking.\n\nThe case underwent mediation, with both parties agreeing to a settlement. On January 28, 2009, an order granting motion for final approval of settlement and motion for approval of stipulated attorneys' fees and reimbursement of costs was filed, effectively resolving the lawsuit. The settlement included a maximum payment of $3,875,000 to create a settlement fund, out of which up to $2,600,000 would be used to pay valid claims to class members, up to $950,000 would be awarded as attorneys' fees and costs, and up to $250,000 would be used for costs of claims administration, with specific distribution formulas applied based on varying circumstances of the class members. The case was then closed.\n\nAdditionally, the court excluded Rita Kramer, an objector who had raised concerns unrelated to the substance of the settlement, specifically about her attorney-client interaction with Mark E.

On or about October 18, 2006, PlaintiffDENNIS LEE BUTLER (herein after referred\n\n4 to as \"Plaintiff\u2019) was arrested on warrants issued for vehicle code violations and transported to Santa\n\n5 Cruz County Jail where, prior to arraignment, he was striped naked and, after waiting several\n\n6 minutes during which time he was observed by multiple deputies, given clothing and taken with\n\n7 several other detainees to housing where, in the presence of other detainees, he was required to\n\n8 remove all of his clothes, bend over, spread his buttocks so that his anal area could be observed, then\n\n9 turn around and lift his penis and scrotum so that the area of his genitalia could be scrutinized.\n\n10 These procedures were performed, in a group so that Plaintiff could see and be seen by the other\n\n11 detainees similarly strip searched.\n\n12\n\n11. Plaintiff was then placed in housing until it was time for him to go to Court to be\n\n13 arraigned at which time, prior to leaving housing, he was again subjected to a group strip search, this\n\n14 time in the presence of females, before being taken to Court at which he was ordered released on his\n\n15 own recognizance. Upon returning from Court, Plaintiff was again subjected to a group strip search\n\n16 and released from Santa Cruz County Jail.\n\n17\n\n12. Within six (6) months of the strip searches described in the previous paragraph,\n\n18 Plaintiff filed a group government tort claim for himself and for all those persons similarly situate\n\n19 (a copy of said claim is attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\", and incorporated here into the extent relevant\n\n20 by this reference).

As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, Plaintiffand\n\n9 each of the persons similarly situated whom he purports to represents, suffered physical, mental, and\n\n10 emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and state and federal\n\n11 statutory and constitutional rights, and are entitled to recover damages, according to proof, and those\n\nI2 charged with misdemeanors, not involving violence, drugs or weapons, are entitled to recover\n\n13 damages, according to proof, but at a minimum $1,000 as specified in Califomia Penal Code \u00a7\n\n14 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code \u00a7 52 and 52.1 (b); while those charged with\n\n15 felonies not involving violence, drugs or weapons are entitled to collect damages according to proof,\n\n16 as are those persons charged with offenses involving violence, drugs or weapons who could have\n\n17 been legally strip searched upon intake, but who were repeatedly strip searched, strip searched in\n\n18 groups, and/or strip searched after being OR\u2019d or after their charges had been dismissed.\n\n19\n\nCLASS CLAIMS\n\n20\n\n16.

In addition, the searches complained of herein\n\n5 were repetitive without any reasonable belief that the Plaintiff, or those person similarly situated\n\n6 whom he represents, had acquired contraband following the prior strip search. Furthermore, the\n\n7 searches complained of herein were performed without Defendants taking reasonable precautions\n\n8 to ensure that Plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, was searched in an area affording\n\n9 privacy and was not observed by others not participating in the search but, to the contrary, were, in\n\n10 fact, performed in groups and when going to and returning from Court, performed in places where\n\n11 Plaintiff, and others similarly situated, could be and were view by members of the opposite sex.\n\n12\n\n17.

The class includes all persons who were subjected to repetitive strip searches with no\n\n21 reasonable suspicion to believe that the detainees searched had acquired contraband subsequent to\n\n22 the prior search.

These are claims common to other members of the class or sub-class of those whom\n\n4 Plaintiff seeks to represent. Each class member suffered actual damages as a result of being\n\n5 subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search. The actual damages suffered by the\n\n6 representative Plaintiff is similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by each class\n\n7 member.\n\n8\n\n23. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n\n9 Plaintiffwitl fairly and adequately protect the class interests. Plaintiff\u2019s interests are consistent wit\n\n10 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class, even though not each member of the class will,\n\n11 necessarily, have been strip searched under all of the policies complained of herein or be in the sub-\n\n12 class of persons entitled to damages under Penal Code \u00a7 4030 and/or Civil Code \u00a7 52 and 52.1.\n\n13\n\n24. hi accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 (b)(1)(A), prosecutions\n\n14 of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or\n\n15 varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible\n\n16 standards of conduct for the parties opposing the Complaint.\n\n17\n\n25. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions\n\n18 of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent\n\n19 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter,\n\n20 substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their\n\n21 interests.\n\n22\n\n26. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiff is\n\n23 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendants have acted on grounds generally\n\n24 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n\n25 respect to the class as a whole.\n\n26\n\n27. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action\n\n27 is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy\n\n28 between the parties.

Plaintiff also is\n\n3 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small\n\n4 that separate suits would be impracticable. Plaintiffis informed and believes, and thereupon alleges,\n\n5 that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them. Plaintiff is\n\n6 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one\n\n7 forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., the SANTA CRUZ County Jail. It\n\n8 will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather\n\n9 than in multiple Courts.\n\n10\n\n28. Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members. Plaintiff is\n\n11 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the identities of the class members may be\n\n12 ascertained lYom records maintained by SANTA CRUZ COUNTY and Defendant SANTA CRUZ\n\n13 COUNTY SHERIFF STEVE ROBBINS and the Defendants\u2019 Sheriff\u2019s Department. Plaintiff is\n\n14 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendants\u2019 records reflect the identities,\n\n15 including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody ha the\n\n16. SANTA CRUZ County Jail. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records\n\n17 of and maintained by Defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity search,\n\n18 when the search or searches occurred, where the search or searches occurred, whether any reasonable\n\n19 suspicion for such search existed and was recorded in a supervisor-approved writing, whether the\n\n20 search was conducted in a group, when persons searched were arraigned, and the charges on which\n\n21 such persons were arrested. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that all of the\n\n22 foregoing information is contained in Defendants\u2019 computer system and that the information\n\n23 necessary to identify the class members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their\n\n24 arrests and/or release from custody, is readily available from said computer system.\n\n25\n\n29. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(2)(b), class members\n\n26 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individua\n\n27 notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.

The Parties are requesting that the Court approve the Settlement.\n\nA. Parties to the Settlement.\n\nThe parties to the Settlement are the Plaintiff named in Butler, et al. v. County of Santa Cruz, et al., United States District Court, Northern District, Case No. Case No. C 07-00941 JF on behalf of himself and the Settlement Class, and various defendants including the County of Santa Cruz.

Up to $250,000 of the Settlement Fund may be used for costs of claims administration. Up to $2,600,000 may be used to pay valid claims. The representative plaintiff will receive a payment of $75,000, subject to Court approval.\n\n2. Payments to Class Members Who File Claims.\n\nMoney for the class will be paid out based on a distribution formula, subject to payments being proportionately reduced if the total value of verified claims exceeds $2,600,000.\n\nPursuant to that distribution formula, all members of the PRE-ARRAIGNMENT STRIP SEARCH CLASS, as defined above, booked during the Class Period, upon return of a verified Claim Form, shall receive the following:\n\na.\n\nFifteen Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) for each booking, up to two (2), on a non-VDW Misdemeanor charge unless,\n\nwithin seven (7) years prior to the qualifying booking, the SCM had been arrested on two or more occasions on\n\nVDW offenses, whether Felony or Misdemeanor Offenses, in Santa Cruz County or, at the time of such booking,\n\nwas on parole or searchable probation;\n\nb.\n\nTwelve Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,250.00) for each booking, up to two (2), on a non-VDW Felony charge unless,\n\nwithin seven (7) years prior to the qualifying booking, the SCM had been arrested on two or more occasions on\n\nVDW offenses, whether Felony or Misdemeanor offenses, in Santa Cruz County or, at the time of such booking, was\n\non parole or searchable probation;\n\nc.\n\nThree Hundred Fifty Dollars ($350.00) if the SCM was booked on a non-VDW Felony or Misdemeanor offense and\n\nwas on probation, the conditions of which included a requirement to submit to a search, and who was not arrested in\n\nSanta Cruz County on two or more occasions on VDW offenses, whether Felony or Misdemeanor offenses, within\n\nthe seven (7) years proceeding the qualifying booking.\n\nAll POST RELEASE STRIP SEARCH CLASS members booked during the Class Period on any offense who, within eight (8) days of booking were ordered released by the Court and strip searched following return to jail, shall receive Twelve Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,250.00), if the offense on which the person was booked was a misdemeanor; or Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00) if the offense on which the person was booked was a Felony. Regardless of the number of times a person was strip searched following being ordered released within eight (8) days of booking, persons in the POST RELEASE STRIP SEARCH CLASS will receive only one payment for any and all post release strip searches. Persons in the POST RELEASE STRIP SEARCH CLASS may also receive payments if they qualify for membership in the PRE-ARRAIGNMENT STRIP SEARCH CLASS.\n\nIn addition to the sums specified above, all SCMs in the PRE-ARRAIGNMENT STRIP SEARCH CLASS will become eligible to receive additional sums, referred to as \u201cEnhancements\u201d of Five Hundred Dollars for each applicable condition if they were under 21 or over 60 at the time of the qualifying Strip Search, had a physical or mental disability at the time of Strip Search, or were pregnant at the time of Strip Search.

All documentation of such claimed injuries will be provided to counsel for the County, who will be afforded a reasonable period of time to investigate each such claim, including taking depositions and obtaining additional records. In the event that Class Counsel and the County\u2019s Counsel cannot agree on an amount to resolve the claim of any SCM described in this paragraph, all documentation pertaining to that SCM\u2019s claim will be submitted to the Special Master, along with each counsel\u2019s proposed amount for an award, and the Special Master will determine the amount of the award, based upon the documents submitted to him.\n3.

Also, please note that Class Members who have already settled their claims with the County of Santa Cruz or gone to trial with the County of Santa Cruz cannot receive a payment under this settlement. If you submit a Claim Form, you will be bound by the Settlement and receive money (if you are a class member). If you do not submit a Claim form but did not exclude yourself from the class, you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and dismissal entered in this case, but you will not receive any money.\nBy participating in the Settlement you will be waiving all your rights to all claims up to July 14, 2007, related to strip searches that took place in any Santa Cruz County correctional facility, even those of which you are not aware at present. This waiver will include a waiver of the provisions of California Civil Code \u00a71542, which provides that \u201ca general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\u201d By participating, you will be giving up unsuspected claims in the areas covered by the litigation.\n2. Exclude Yourself From the Class.\nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called \u201cexcluding\u201d yourself. If you exclude yourself, you cannot get a payment and you cannot object to the Settlement. Any Court orders will not apply to you. To exclude yourself, you must sign a request for exclusion letter that states that you want to be excluded from Butler, et al. v. County of Santa Cruz, et al., Case No. C 07-00941 JF. Your exclusion letter must be mailed and postmarked before December 18, 2008, to: Butler v. County of Santa Cruz Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 8060, San Rafael, CA 94912-8060.\nIf you do not follow these instructions properly, you will lose your right to exclude yourself. If you exclude yourself, you cannot get any money from the Settlement and you cannot tell the Court you do not like the Settlement (which is called \u201cobjecting\u201d).

One\n\n22 objector, Ms. Rita Kramer, appeared telephonically after having submitted a detailed objection to\n\n23 the settlement via facsimile on January 15, 2009. The Clerk of the Court is directed to file the\n\n24 objection.\n\n25\n\nMs. Kramer does not appear to object to the substance of the settlement but rather\n\n26 complains that she was deprived unfairly of the opportunity to be a named class representative.\n\n27\n\n28\n\n1 This disposition is not designated for publication in the official reports.\n\nCase No. C 07-00941 JF (RS) ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT ETC.

She also accuses Mr. Merin of\n\n4 preparing the paperwork for her to opt in as a claimant in the class action without her consent.\n\n5\n\nMs. Kramer\u2019s objections relate solely to her attorney-client interactions with Mr. Merin.\n\n6 Because the objections do not relate to the substance of the settlement, they do not weigh against\n\n7 approval of the settlement. Given that Ms. Kramer is the only objector, and because the Court\n\n8 concludes that the settlement is fair and adequate and in the best interest of the class, the Court\n\n9 will grant the motion for final approval.\n\n10\n\nWith respect to the motion for approval of stipulated attorneys\u2019 fees and reimbursement\n\n11 of costs, the Court concludes that the requested fees and costs are fair and reasonable and are\n\n12 well-documented by the parties\u2019 submissions. Accordingly, the Court will grant that motion as\n\n13 well.\n\n14\n\nBecause Ms. Kramer stated unequivocally in the record that she did not wish to be a part\n\n15 of the class and did not wish to participate in the settlement, she is hereby excluded from the\n\n16 settlement class. Ms. Kramer is advised to consult with an attorney regarding her interactions\n\n17 with Mr. Merin in the event she wishes to pursue her concerns further.\n\n18\n\nORDER\n\n19\n\nFor good cause shown, it is hereby ordered that:\n\n20\n\n(1) the motion for final approval of settlement is GRANTED;\n\n21\n\n(2) the motion for approval of stipulated attorneys\u2019 fees and reimbursement of costs is\n\nGRANTED;\n\n22\n\n(3) the Clerk of the Court shall file the objection of Ms. Kramer submitted to\n\n23\n\nchambers on January 15, 2009; and\n\n24\n\n(4) a separate order and judgment of dismissal shall be filed concurrently herewith.\n\n25\n\n26 DATED: January 28, 2009\n\n27\n\nJEREMY FOGEL\n\n28\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\n2\nCase No. C 07-00941 JF (RS) ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT ETC.
